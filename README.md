# Trade-Analysis
To determine which of our recent trades (current and past semester) are currently outperforming their sector etf. If the trades are currently open (have not been closed by selling shares), the sector outperformance should be live as price changes every day. If trades have been closed, we should display statically the performance of that trade vs the performance of just buying and holding the etf for the duration of the trade. Overall, this project lets us know if our trades are informed and "good", as we can see every day if we're outperforming sector etf.
